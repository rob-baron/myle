I want to try to capture my ballroom notes in Leban notation.

Although I find drawing the notation a bit laborious I am 
in the process of evisioning a editor to do this a bit more
efficiently.

I haven't yet decided on the architecture for the entire 
project as of yet.  Though I have split off the libjson
part into it's own library.  I am currently using json
to hold the details for my notes as it is very easy to
parse.

At this point, I am placing into github what I have
and it is by no means even close to working.
